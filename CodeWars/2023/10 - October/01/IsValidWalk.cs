/* --- 6 kyu Take a Ten Minutes Walk ---
 * ------------Task:
 * You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too
 * early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides 
 * its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an 
 * array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single 
 * block for each letter (direction) and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create
 * a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't 
 * want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.
 * 
 * Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 
 * 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).
